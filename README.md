Eternal Winter plunges you into the icy depths of Luna, a frigid moon orbiting Nauvis. Explore the Reclaim Center, master radiation shielding, and unlock the powerful Graviton Matter Obliterator. Face the challenge of navigating complex recipes involving Cold Biters and volatile materials, as you craft your way through a captivating narrative filled with danger and innovation. Uncover the secrets buried beneath the ice, and transform Luna's harsh landscape into a thriving baseâ€”if you can survive the chilling trials ahead!

## New Features

### Reclaim Center
Unlock the Reclaim Center early in your journey to access innovative recipes leveraging empty barrels for recycling. Discover the power of infinite technology, enhancing your efficiency and productivity as you convert recycled materials into valuable steel.

### Radiation Shields
Navigate the dangers of radiation with advanced shielding technology. Every assembler and furnace requires at least 85% protection to avoid catastrophic failure. This design mechanic invites strategic planning and resource management, as machines will ignite if left unshielded.

### Research Center
Unlock the mysteries of Luna through the Research Center, a high-tier resource investment that allows you to convert local resources into knowledge. Invest wisely to unlock powerful recipes for oxygen production and moon rock refinement, vital for later challenges.

### Graviton Matter Obliterator (GMO)
Achieve ultimate power with the GMO, a late-game weapon harnessing complex recipes from the Radioactivity Center. Learn to mix fluids and manage materials effectively to cool this formidable cannon, and decide between singular or area targeting modes for maximum destruction.

### Terraform Hub
Transform your surroundings! The Terraform Hub utilizes excess heat from arc furnaces to convert wood and oxygen into coal and steam, turning local resources into essential energy outputs while introducing new recycling mechanics.

### Radioactivity Center
The heart of the mod, the Radioactivity Center, unlocks an intricate web of recipes leading to the GMO and the elusive Radioactive Shell. This complex system blends alien artifacts, bio inputs, and radioactive materials, providing a robust puzzle for players seeking the ultimate challenge.

## The Challenge
Eternal Winter is not just about survival but also about mastering the art of logistics and resource management. The convoluted recipe loops require careful planning and execution, testing your ingenuity and strategy. As you engage with Cold Biters and other enemies while unraveling these complex systems, you'll find that each challenge brings you closer to harnessing the ultimate power of the Graviton Matter Obliterator.

Prepare yourself for a chilling adventure filled with innovation, danger, and discovery. Can you conquer the Eternal Winter?
